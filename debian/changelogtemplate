raspberrypi-firmware-nokernel (___version___~nokernel1) wheezy-staging; urgency=low

  * Fix name of some files in debian/ to match renamed firmware package
  * Set source format to 1.0 since we don't have an orig tarball and
    3.0 (native) does stupid shit like ignoring files.
  * Remove kernel, reduce list of files to apply diversion hack to to reflect
    removal of kernel kernel.
  * Rename firmware package to reflect the fact it doesn't contain a kernel
  * Alter dependencies as needed to reflect renamed firmware package
