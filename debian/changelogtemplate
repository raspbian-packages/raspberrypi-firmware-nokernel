raspberrypi-firmware-nokernel (___version___~nokernel1) jessie-staging; urgency=low

  * Fix name of some files in debian/ to match renamed firmware package
  * Set source format to 1.0 since we don't have an orig tarball and
    3.0 (native) does stupid shit like ignoring files.
  * Remove kernel and it's associated package
    + reduce list of files to apply diversion hack to to reflect removal of kernel kernel.
    + remove dependency on raspberrypi-kernel.
  * Rename firmware package to reflect the fact it doesn't depend on a kernel
    (in earlier versions that it didn't provide a kernel)
    + add conflicts on raspberrypi-bootloader and raspberrypi-kernel
  * Add diversions for dtbs in firmware package.
  * Alter dependencies as needed to reflect renamed firmware package
  * Create directory needed for diversions.
  * Alter dtbs for compatbility with 4.4 kernels.
